     * Some advanced properties setting the configuration that the WebRTC streams of the user owning the token will have in Kurento Media Server.
     * You can adjust:
     * - `videoMaxRecvBandwidth`: maximum number of Kbps that the client owning the token will be able to receive from Kurento Media Server. 0 means unconstrained. Giving a value to this property will override
     * the global configuration set in [OpenVidu Server configuration](/en/stable/reference-docs/openvidu-config/)
     * (parameter `OPENVIDU_STREAMS_VIDEO_MAX_RECV_BANDWIDTH`) for every incoming stream of the user owning the token.
     * _**WARNING**: the lower value set to this property limits every other bandwidth of the WebRTC pipeline this server-to-client stream belongs to. This includes the user publishing the stream and every other user subscribed to the stream_
     * - `videoMinRecvBandwidth`: minimum number of Kbps that the client owning the token will try to receive from Kurento Media Server. 0 means unconstrained. Giving a value to this property will override
     * the global configuration set in [OpenVidu Server configuration](/en/stable/reference-docs/openvidu-config/)
     * (parameter `OPENVIDU_STREAMS_VIDEO_MIN_RECV_BANDWIDTH`) for every incoming stream of the user owning the token
     * - `videoMaxSendBandwidth`: maximum number of Kbps that the client owning the token will be able to send to Kurento Media Server. 0 means unconstrained. Giving a value to this property will override
     * the global configuration set in [OpenVidu Server configuration](/en/stable/reference-docs/openvidu-config/)
     * (parameter `OPENVIDU_STREAMS_VIDEO_MAX_SEND_BANDWIDTH`) for every outgoing stream of the user owning the token.
     * _**WARNING**: this value limits every other bandwidth of the WebRTC pipeline this client-to-server stream belongs to. This includes every other user subscribed to the stream_
     * - `videoMinSendBandwidth`: minimum number of Kbps that the client owning the token will try to send to Kurento Media Server. 0 means unconstrained. Giving a value to this property will override
     * the global configuration set in [OpenVidu Server configuration](/en/stable/reference-docs/openvidu-config/)
     * (parameter `OPENVIDU_STREAMS_VIDEO_MIN_SEND_BANDWIDTH`) for every outgoing stream of the user owning the token
     * - `allowedFilters`: names of the filters the user owning the token will be able to apply. See [Voice and video filters](/en/stable/advanced-features/filters/)
